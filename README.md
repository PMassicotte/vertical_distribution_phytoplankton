This project aims at exploring how various metrics/proxies can give insights on the vertical distribution of the phytoplankton biomass in the water column.

Four main indicators that can give insights into the phytoplankton biomass in the water column:

1.  Fluorescence

2.  Pigments

3.  Particle beam attenuation coefficient (CP)

4.  Particle backscattering coefficient (bbp)

This project is based on the data measured during the Green Edge oceanographic cruise conducted in the Baffin Bay in 2016.
